## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing inventory operations for a retail business. The main objective is to minimize excess stock, reduce understock scenarios, and improve overall inventory efficiency by examining SKU movement, reorder trends, seasonal patterns, and product velocity.

## 🔍 Key Insights

### 📦 Inventory Overview

- **Understocked & Overstocked SKUs**  
  - 30 SKUs identified as understocked and 30 as overstocked.
  - Suggests a functional replenishment system with scope for improvement in precision.

- **Days Inventory Remaining**  
  - Over 1100 days of inventory in hand, tying up significant capital.
  - Indicates risk of overstocking, particularly in slow-moving categories.

- **Reorder Activity**  
  - Reorder counts range from 4,035 to 4,120.
  - Stores S003, S004, and S005 show high reorder frequency, likely due to efficient inventory cycles or strong sales performance.

---

### 🚀 SKU Movement and Velocity

- **Fast & Moderate Movers**  
  - Top 75–100% velocity items mostly concentrated among few high-performing SKUs (~400,000 units sold).
  - Moderate movers (50–75%) show stable movement across more diverse products.

- **Slow & Very Slow Movers**  
  - A large portion of inventory falls into 0–50% velocity range.
  - These SKUs require rationalization to free up capital and improve ROI.

---

### 🗃️ Category & Seasonal Trends

- **Overstock Patterns by Category & Season**  
  - Clothing, Furniture, and Electronics are frequently overstocked, especially in **Autumn** and **Spring**.
  - Toys (Spring) and Groceries also show minor overstock tendencies.

- **Forecast vs Inventory**  
  - Demand forecasts often exceed current inventory in major categories like **Clothing** and **Electronics**.
  - Mismatched projections can result in missed sales or increased overstock.

---

### 📆 Temporal Trends

- **Inventory Turnover (Monthly)**  
  - Fluctuates between 1,400 and 1,600 units.
  - **July and September** see peaks; **August** has the lowest turnover, suggesting a seasonal slowdown or overstock accumulation.

---

## 🧠 Strategic Recommendations

- **🔻 Reduce Excess Inventory**  
  Implement clearance or promotional campaigns targeting chronic overstock areas (e.g., Clothing/Furniture in Autumn and Spring).

- **🎯 Improve Replenishment Precision**  
  Use reorder trends from high-performing stores (S003, S004, S005) to guide system-wide optimization.

- **📉 Rationalize Slow-Moving SKUs**  
  Discontinue or consolidate low-velocity SKUs to reduce inventory bloat.

- **📈 Align Inventory with Forecasts**  
  Regularly update demand forecasting models and dynamically adjust inventory levels.

- **🌎 Seasonal & Regional Adjustments**  
  Modify strategies based on historical sales spikes (e.g., boost stock before July/September, reduce before August).

- **📊 Continuous Monitoring**  
  Set up dashboards and review cadences to monitor improvements in turnover, movement, and category performance.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

The current inventory system is operationally sound but suffers from overstock and low-performing SKUs. Targeted improvements in SKU rationalization, dynamic forecasting, and seasonal alignment can significantly boost efficiency, reduce costs, and meet customer demand effectively.
